The simulation-to-reality gap poses significant challenges for deploying reinforcement learning-trained robotic systems in real-world environments. This paper presents a comprehensive study on bridging this gap for pick-and-place tasks using a UR5e robotic manipulator equipped with a Robotiq 2F-85 gripper and an eye-in-hand Intel RealSense D435i camera. We develop a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) based agent trained in a high-fidelity MuJoCo simulation environment built on the Homestri UR5e RL framework. Our approach features a five-phase curriculum learning system totaling 27 million timesteps, robust reward engineering to prevent reward hacking, comprehensive visual and physical domain randomization, and a custom SimToRealCNN architecture for processing RGBD camera observations. The training leverages CUDA acceleration on RTX 4060 hardware for efficient policy learning. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our curriculum-based training methodology, with the agent successfully progressing through approach learning, contact refinement, grasping, manipulation, and mastery phases in the physics-accurate MuJoCo environment.

% Introducing the sim-to-real challenge in robotic manipulation
\section{Introduction}
The deployment of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in real-world robotic systems remains challenging due to the simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) gap. While RL agents can achieve remarkable performance in simulated environments, their policies often fail when transferred to physical robots due to discrepancies in dynamics, sensor noise, and environmental conditions \cite{zhao2020sim}. High-fidelity simulators like MuJoCo aim to minimize this gap by providing accurate physics simulation and efficient rendering capabilities.

Pick-and-place tasks represent fundamental challenges in robotic manipulation, requiring precise visual-motor coordination and robust grasping strategies. A key challenge in training RL agents for such tasks is designing a reward function that guides learning effectively without being susceptible to "reward hacking," where the agent finds loopholes to maximize reward without completing the task.

This paper investigates sim-to-real transfer for vision-based pick-and-place tasks using a UR5e robotic manipulator within the Homestri UR5e RL framework. Our contributions include: (1) a comprehensive five-phase curriculum learning methodology spanning 27 million timesteps for training PPO agents with eye-in-hand visual observations in MuJoCo, (2) a robust, multi-stage reward function with anti-hacking mechanisms and curriculum-aware progression, (3) domain randomization strategies tailored for visual manipulation tasks with progressive intensity scaling, (4) a custom SimToRealCNN architecture optimized for processing RGBD camera data from RealSense D435i sensors, (5) CUDA-accelerated training pipeline optimized for RTX 4060 hardware, and (6) comprehensive training monitoring and breakthrough prediction systems for long-horizon learning.

\section{Related Work}
The deployment of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in real-world robotic systems is challenged by the simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) gap. While RL agents can achieve high performance in simulated environments, their policies often fail when transferred to physical robots due to discrepancies in dynamics, sensor noise, and environmental conditions \cite{zhao2020sim}. Domain randomization has emerged as a key technique to bridge this gap by systematically varying the simulation parameters to improve policy robustness \cite{tobin2017domain}. Visual domain randomization, in particular, has been effective in vision-based manipulation tasks by introducing variations in lighting, textures, and camera parameters \cite{garcia2023robust}.

Eye-in-hand vision systems have gained attention for their ability to provide dynamic viewpoints and improved manipulation capabilities. Previous work has explored both traditional computer vision approaches and learning-based methods for eye-in-hand manipulation, with recent studies focusing on end-to-end learning from visual observations \cite{kim2023giving}. For pick-and-place tasks, which are fundamental in robotic manipulation, RL has been applied to learn policies that can handle object grasping and placement \cite{gomes2021deep, iriondo2019pick}.

Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) \cite{schulman2017proximal} has been successfully used in robotic manipulation tasks due to its sample efficiency and stability. The combination of PPO with visual observations has shown promise for complex manipulation behaviors, though sim-to-real transfer remains challenging.

In this work, we build upon these advancements by training a PPO agent in a MuJoCo simulation environment built on the Homestri UR5e RL framework \cite{chuang2024homestri}, incorporating a five-phase curriculum learning system and domain randomization strategies tailored for visual manipulation tasks with an eye-in-hand camera configuration. Our approach features comprehensive CUDA acceleration for RTX 4060 hardware and advanced monitoring systems for long-horizon training.

% Describing the system setup and simulation environment
\section{Methodology}

\subsection{System Architecture}
Our experimental setup consists of a Universal Robots UR5e manipulator equipped with a Robotiq 2F-85 gripper and an Intel RealSense D435i camera mounted on the end-effector in an eye-in-hand configuration. The camera provides both RGB and depth information, with the simulation using 64$\times$64 resolution for training efficiency while maintaining rich visual features for the learning agent. 

Training is conducted on an HP Victus gaming laptop equipped with AMD Ryzen 5 processor, 16GB RAM, and NVIDIA RTX 4060 8GB GPU with CUDA acceleration for optimal performance. This consumer-grade hardware demonstrates the accessibility of our training methodology while maintaining efficient policy learning through optimized CUDA implementations.

\subsection{Simulation Environment}
We develop our training environment using MuJoCo physics simulation within the Homestri UR5e RL framework. MuJoCo provides high-fidelity, real-time physics simulation with accurate contact dynamics and efficient computation suitable for reinforcement learning applications. The simulated UR5e robot utilizes the official Universal Robots MJCF model, ensuring kinematic and dynamic accuracy. The Robotiq 2F-85 gripper is integrated via MJCF format for precise gripper control. A virtual RealSense D435i camera is positioned identically to the real setup in an eye-in-hand configuration, providing RGBD observations at 64$\times$64 resolution to the learning agent for computational efficiency.

The workspace consists of a table environment where objects (cubes, spheres, and cylinders) are randomly spawned within a designated area. Our \texttt{UR5ePickPlaceEnvEnhanced} environment implements comprehensive curriculum learning with five distinct phases: (1) approach\_learning (5M steps), (2) contact\_refinement (4M steps), (3) grasping (8M steps), (4) manipulation (6M steps), and (5) mastery (4M steps), totaling 27 million timesteps. The environment features advanced stuck detection, progressive domain randomization, and detailed camera visibility tracking for robust policy learning.

\subsection{Reinforcement Learning Approach}
We employ Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) \cite{schulman2017proximal}, implemented using the Stable-Baselines3 (SB3) library \cite{raffin2021stable}, as our learning algorithm. The agent is trained within our custom \texttt{UR5ePickPlaceEnvEnhanced} environment compatible with the Gymnasium standard.

\textbf{Observation Space:} The agent's observation space is designed to be comprehensive, providing all necessary information for complex decision-making. It includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Robot State (35 dimensions):} Joint positions, velocities, and end-effector pose of the UR5e's six articulated joints, along with gripper state and additional kinematic information.
    \item \textbf{Object State (13 dimensions):} The current 3D position, orientation (quaternion), and physical properties of the target object, including shape classification and scale parameters.
    \item \textbf{Goal State (7 dimensions):} Target placement location and orientation for the pick-and-place task.
    \item \textbf{Visual Data (64$^2$ $\times$ 4 dimensions):} RGBD image from the eye-in-hand RealSense camera at 64$\times$64 resolution for training efficiency, providing 16,384 visual dimensions.
    \item \textbf{Visibility Flag (1 dimension):} Binary indicator of object visibility within the camera's field of view, calculated through our progressive callback system.
\end{itemize}
The total observation vector size is 56 + 16,384 = 16,440 dimensions, providing a balance between information richness and computational efficiency optimized for CUDA training on RTX 4060 hardware.

\textbf{Action Space:} The action space consists of 7 continuous values: six joint velocity commands for the UR5e's articulated joints and one continuous gripper command for the Robotiq 2F-85 gripper. Actions are scaled and clipped to prevent overly aggressive movements that could damage the robot or destabilize the simulation.

	extbf{Reward Function:} To overcome the challenges of sparse rewards and prevent reward hacking, we implement a dense, curriculum-aware reward function with several anti-hacking mechanisms:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 	extbf{Curriculum-Based Staged Rewards:} The learning process progresses through five distinct phases with phase-specific reward structures: approach\_learning focuses on safe approach and contact, contact\_refinement emphasizes precise gripper positioning, grasping rewards successful object grasping, manipulation targets full pick-and-place completion, and mastery requires collision-free execution.
    \item 	extbf{Reaching Reward:} A continuous distance-based reward encourages the gripper to approach the target object, with proximity bonuses for being very close ($<$ 5cm), close ($<$ 10cm), or approaching ($<$ 20cm).
    \item 	extbf{Grasp Validation:} The grasping state is determined by contact detection between gripper fingers and the object, preventing rewards for failed grasp attempts.
    \item 	extbf{Lifting Reward:} A reward proportional to the object's height above the table surface encourages successful lifting behavior.
    \item 	extbf{Transport and Placement:} Distance-based rewards guide the agent to move the grasped object toward the target location, with significant bonuses for successful placement within the target zone.
    \item 	extbf{Progressive Success Thresholds:} Each curriculum phase has specific success rate thresholds (10\% for approach\_learning, 30\% for contact\_refinement, 50\% for grasping, 70\% for manipulation, 85\% for mastery) that trigger automatic advancement.
    \item 	extbf{Behavioral Incentives:} Small rewards for action smoothness encourage stable, human-like movements, while orientation rewards ensure proper gripper alignment during approach.
    \item 	extbf{Safety Penalties:} Moderate penalties for joint limit violations and excessive joint velocities promote safe operation while avoiding overly harsh punishment that could hinder learning.
\end{itemize}
The reward structure provides values typically ranging from $-10$ to $+60$, with successful task completion yielding rewards around 50 points. This carefully balanced, curriculum-aware approach provides continuous learning signals while avoiding common failure modes like reward hacking.

\subsection{Implementation Details}
The training pipeline is built on the Homestri UR5e RL framework using MuJoCo for physics simulation. The environment interface follows the Gymnasium standard for seamless integration with modern RL libraries. The PPO algorithm and policy network are implemented using PyTorch 2.0 and Stable-Baselines3 (SB3) 2.1.0, with CUDA acceleration optimized for RTX 4060 8GB GPU hardware.

Our architecture features a custom \texttt{SimToRealCNNExtractor} specifically designed for processing the high-dimensional RGBD observations from the eye-in-hand camera. The \texttt{SimToRealCNNExtractor} combines convolutional layers for visual processing with fully connected layers for proprioceptive and object state information. The visual backbone uses batch normalization and residual connections to improve training stability and feature learning for sim-to-real transfer.

The environment includes extensive domain randomization capabilities through our \texttt{CurriculumDomainRandomizer} module, five-phase curriculum learning support via \texttt{CurriculumManager}, advanced stuck detection mechanisms, and comprehensive monitoring systems including \texttt{DetailedLoggingCallback} and \texttt{ProgressiveTrainingCallback} for robust long-horizon training. Training leverages \texttt{VecNormalize} for observation and reward normalization, with all computation optimized for CUDA acceleration on consumer-grade hardware (HP Victus with RTX 4060 8GB, 16GB RAM).

\subsection{Domain Randomization}
To bridge the sim-to-real gap, we implement comprehensive domain randomization strategies within MuJoCo through our \texttt{CurriculumDomainRandomizer} module. The randomization is curriculum-based, with randomization intensity scaling progressively from 10\% to 100\% based on the agent's learning progress across the five-phase curriculum.

\textbf{Visual Randomization:} Lighting conditions, object materials and textures, background environments, and camera parameters (intrinsics, noise characteristics) are varied during training. The RealSense camera simulation includes realistic noise models and depth artifacts to improve real-world transfer.

\textbf{Physical Randomization:} Object mass, friction coefficients, contact parameters, gripper dynamics, and joint properties are randomized within realistic bounds. The randomization preserves the physical plausibility of the simulation while building robustness.

\textbf{Geometric Randomization:} Object spawn positions are randomized within a designated workspace area defined by visual markers in the MuJoCo scene. Object shapes (cubes, spheres, cylinders) and scales are varied according to the curriculum level, with complexity increasing through the five phases.

The \texttt{CurriculumManager} system coordinates randomization intensity with learning progress, ensuring stable early learning while building robustness for real-world deployment. The \texttt{ProgressiveTrainingCallback} monitors success rates and automatically advances curriculum phases when thresholds are met.

% Outlining the experimental setup
\section{Experiments}

\subsection{Training Protocol}
Training is conducted using our integrated training script that leverages \texttt{VecNormalize} for observation normalization and includes comprehensive callback systems for monitoring and evaluation. The training employs a five-phase curriculum learning system with progressive difficulty scaling: (1) approach\_learning (5M steps) focuses on safe approach strategies, (2) contact\_refinement (4M steps) emphasizes precise gripper positioning, (3) grasping (8M steps) develops successful object grasping, (4) manipulation (6M steps) targets full pick-and-place completion, and (5) mastery (4M steps) requires collision-free execution with 85\%+ success rates.

The training pipeline includes checkpoint saving every 51,200 steps, detailed logging via \texttt{DetailedLoggingCallback}, evaluation callbacks with \texttt{ProgressiveTrainingCallback} for curriculum advancement, and progressive domain randomization scaling. Training runs for the full 27 million timesteps across all curriculum phases, with automatic phase advancement triggered by success rate thresholds. The system includes breakthrough prediction algorithms and comprehensive progress monitoring optimized for long-horizon learning on CUDA hardware (RTX 4060 8GB with 16GB system RAM).

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
We evaluate performance using success rate (percentage of successful pick-and-place completions), episode length (steps required for task completion), policy stability across multiple trials, and curriculum progression metrics. Our evaluation includes camera visibility tracking, action diversity analysis, and explained variance monitoring to assess training health and breakthrough prediction.

Key performance indicators include: (1) success rate progression through the five curriculum phases, (2) camera visibility percentage calculated via our progressive callback system, (3) action diversity metrics indicating exploration vs exploitation balance, (4) collision rate monitoring for safety assessment, and (5) explained variance tracking for policy learning assessment. The evaluation system provides comprehensive breakthrough timeline predictions based on curriculum progress and learning indicators.

\subsection{Sim-to-Real Transfer}
Trained policies are deployed on the physical UR5e system without additional fine-tuning. The real-world evaluation protocol mirrors the simulation environment as closely as possible, with objects placed within the specified workspace region.

\section{Discussion}
Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of five-phase curriculum learning for vision-based pick-and-place tasks using PPO and progressive domain randomization within a MuJoCo-based framework. The eye-in-hand configuration presents unique challenges, as the camera viewpoint changes dynamically during manipulation, requiring the agent to learn robust visual-motor coordination through our SimToRealCNN architecture.

The use of curriculum-based learning with automatic phase advancement ensures systematic skill development, while the \texttt{CurriculumDomainRandomizer} allows for progressive complexity scaling. The custom \texttt{SimToRealCNNExtractor} effectively processes the high-dimensional RGBD observations while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for CUDA-accelerated RL training on consumer-grade RTX 4060 8GB hardware.

Key factors contributing to successful training include: realistic MuJoCo physics simulation with accurate UR5e modeling, comprehensive five-phase curriculum learning (27M total timesteps), progressive domain randomization with curriculum coordination, custom \texttt{SimToRealCNN} feature extraction optimized for RGBD data, robust curriculum-aware reward engineering that prevents common pitfalls, and comprehensive monitoring systems for long-horizon training. The eye-in-hand configuration, while challenging, enables more adaptive manipulation behaviors compared to fixed camera setups.

The curriculum progression from approach\_learning through mastery represents a systematic approach to complex manipulation skill development, with each phase building upon previous capabilities while introducing new challenges. The automatic advancement based on success rate thresholds ensures proper skill consolidation before complexity increases.

% Proposing future research directions
\section{Future Work}
Future research directions include completing the full 27-million timestep curriculum and evaluating sim-to-real transfer performance on the physical UR5e system. We plan to analyze the effectiveness of each curriculum phase and investigate optimization strategies for the breakthrough timeline prediction algorithms. 

We aim to leverage the advanced domain randomization capabilities of our MuJoCo framework to create even more diverse training scenarios, including dynamic lighting conditions and varying surface materials. Additionally, we plan to implement more sophisticated curriculum learning strategies where the agent can handle varying object complexities and workspace configurations beyond the current spawn area constraints.

Integration with real-world deployment pipelines, including automatic calibration procedures and real-time domain adaptation, represents another important direction. The comprehensive monitoring and breakthrough prediction systems developed in this work provide a foundation for adaptive curriculum scheduling and real-time training optimization. Finally, we plan to explore multi-task learning where a single policy can handle various manipulation primitives beyond pick-and-place, leveraging the robust curriculum learning framework developed here for stacking, sorting, and assembly tasks.
